FUZZY SEARCH LIBRARY COMPARISON
===============================
Created: 2026-01-07

Currently Using: Fuse.js
Alternative:     @m31coding/fuzzy-search (https://github.com/m31coding/fuzzy-search)


@m31coding/fuzzy-search
-----------------------
• Uses sorted n-grams (3-grams) instead of Levenshtein distance
• Faster for typo tolerance, especially transposition errors ("sarah" vs "sarha")
• Built-in prefix + substring search — exact prefix matches rank higher automatically
• Better multi-word handling ("wolff sarah" matches "sarah wolff" at 95% quality)
• Newer library, smaller community


Fuse.js (current)
-----------------
• Uses Levenshtein distance — traditional approach
• More popular (100k+ weekly downloads, mature library)
• Easy weighted field configuration
• Battle-tested, well-documented


For Exercise Search Specifically
--------------------------------
@m31coding might be slightly better because:
  1. Handles transpositions better ("bicep" vs "bicpe")
  2. Naturally prioritizes prefix matches
  3. Designed for frontend autocomplete

However, Fuse.js is working great and is battle-tested.
Consider @m31coding/fuzzy-search if performance issues arise.
